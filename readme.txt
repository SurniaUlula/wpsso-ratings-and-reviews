WPSSO extension to add ratings and reviews for WordPress comments, with aggregate rating meta tags and (optional) Schema Review markup.

== Description ==

<p><strong>WPSSO RAR extends the native WordPress comment system with new rating and review features</strong> &mdash; ratings and reviews can be enabled / disabled per post, new reviews are labeled as reviews (not comments), a star rating can be required before reviews are accepted, replies to reviews are properly labeled as replies / comments, and the colors of star ratings can be customized from the settings page.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO RAR provides <a href="https://schema.org/aggregateRating">Schema aggregateRating</a> with meta tags and (optional) JSON-LD markup</strong> (requires WPSSO JSON Pro extension) &mdash; Google reads the aggregate rating meta tags and/or JSON-LD markup to add rating information to search results!</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO RAR also includes complete <a href="https://schema.org/Review">Schema Review</a> details as (optional) JSON-LD markup</strong> (requires WPSSO JSON Pro extension) &mdash; including information about the review (author name, creation time, and excerpt), along with the threaded replies / comments for each review.</p>

<blockquote>
